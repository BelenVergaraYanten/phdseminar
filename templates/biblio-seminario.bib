	abstract = {Natural gas gained significant attention due to its low carbon emissions and competitive prices in North America relative to other energy sources. The Annual Energy Outlook 2015 projects the U.S. as a net exporter by 2017. Recently, Mexico launched its energy reform, aiming to expand domestic production by opening the market to private investors. The success or failure of these policy changes will impact the development of the natural gas market in North America. To analyze possible pathways of the Mexican energy reform, we develop the North American Natural Gas Model (NANGAM). NANGAM is a long-term partial equilibrium model that allows for endogenous infrastructure expansion and non-linear cost functions. NANGAM is calibrated using the most recent data available from U.S., Canadian, and Mexican sources. We find that, in order to reduce pipeline imports, Mexico depends on economic incentives that lower barriers to infrastructure investment and keep production costs at competitive levels. If reforms to guarantee these incentives are not successfully implemented, growing gas demand in Mexico will be satisfied by further supply from Texas and neighboring states. This will cause a ripple-effect of increasing production in other regions in the U.S. and a shift in trade flows across the continent.},

	abstract = {Despite significant progress made by China in liberalizing its natural gas market, certain key areas such as market access and pricing mechanisms remain controlled by the government. To assess how such distortions impact the market, we have developed a Mixed Complementarity Problem model of China's natural gas industry, with a novel representation of price caps associated with supply obligations. The model is used to assess how government pricing policies and restricted third party access to midstream infrastructure impacted the supply logistics of China's profit maximizing natural gas firms in the year 2015. We find that lifting the price caps for regulated natural gas demand sectors could yield a 4.7\% (1.4 billion USD) reduction in total system cost and reduce the national average of marginal supply costs by 14\%. Improving third party access to the pipeline and regasification infrastructure would result in an additive total cost saving of 7.6\% (2.2 billion USD) and a 16\% reduction in average prices, due to replacing domestic and imported LNG with pipeline imports. The LNG industry would be negatively affected by the reforms investigated in this study, as market players would gain more flexibility in their logistics and would utilize lower cost supply pathways.},
